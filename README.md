This repository now includes demo product pages.

## Running locally

Use PHP's built-in server to test:

```bash
php -S localhost:8000 -t public
```

Open [`http://localhost:8000/product.php`](http://localhost:8000/product.php) in your browser to view the product page. The "Customize ingredients" link leads to `customize.php`, and both forms post to simple endpoints that print the submitted data.
